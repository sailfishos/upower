- BMC#16455 fix with patch
  fix-energy-full-calculation-when-it-is-not-in-sysfs-data.patch 
  If the sysfs does not provide energy_full and energy_full_design
  properties for the battery but provided only the energy property, try
  to calculate the value by using voltage_now, charge_now and charge_full_now
  sysfs entries. Without this patch energy_full was calculated to 0
  and upower uses the highest energy value seen as a "full_energy" 
  in it's calculations and that caused that the battery charge level was
  calculated incorrectly until the battery was loaded once to full.
